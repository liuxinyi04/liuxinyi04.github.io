I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Professor Tarek Abdelzaher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of large language models (LLMs), agent-based modeling, and social simulation. Specifically, I design persona-grounded LLM agents that simulate ideological behavior, belief shifts, and community-level dynamics in response to external events such as propaganda, misinformation, and persuasive narratives.

I work closely with [Professor Dilek Hakkani-Tür](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/dilek) and [Professor Heng Ji](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html), exploring research directions in natural language understanding, multimodal retrieval, and social behavior modeling.

My long-term goal is to develop computational frameworks that bridge LLMs and social science, enabling interpretable, scalable, and language-aware simulations of complex human interactions.
