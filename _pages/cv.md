## Projects
- **DARPA INCAS** (May 2022 – Dec 2024): Influence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking — a multi-year project on understanding influence operations in low-dimensional information spaces and their impact on populations. Developed an interactive demo system that integrates ideology embedding, narrative pathway discovery, and influencer detection. Deployed the system at: incas.csl.illinois.edu, supporting visual exploration and interactive analysis of influence campaigns.
- **NYC Employment Data Analysis** (Nov 2020 – Jan 2021): Created interactive visualizations (R, D3.js) analyzing employment counts and salary trends across demographic groups. Published a project report using R Bookdown: NYC Employment Analysis Book. Finalist, Columbia DSI Best Student Project Competition.

## Work Experience
- **Amazon – Applied Science Intern | Causal Inference, Persona Modeling** (Alexa AI, Summer 2025)
  - Developed a behavior-conditioned LLM framework to simulate realistic user-AI conversations grounded in population-level persona groups.
  - Leveraged causal inference to refine behavioral segmentation and control dialogue synthesis.
  - Demonstrated strong gains in structural realism and behavioral fidelity over eight baseline models.
- **ByteDance – Data Science Intern | Data Mining, User Segmentation** (Summer 2022)
  - Designed and validated user segments using classification metrics (precision, recall, ROC-AUC) and cross-validation.
  - Analyzed large-scale user behavior logs to identify actionable segment-level engagement trends.
  - Built interactive BI dashboards to support product decisions through visualized behavioral insights.
