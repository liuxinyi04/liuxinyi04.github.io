Projects
DARPA INCAS |LLM, PyTorch, Flask, Docker May 2022 – Dec 2024
•DARPA INCAS: Influence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking — a multi-year project on
understanding influence operations in low-dimensional information spaces and their impact on
populations.
•Developed an interactive demo system that integrates ideology embedding, narrative pathway
discovery, and influencer detection.
•Deployed the system at: incas.csl.illinois.edu, supporting visual exploration and interactive analysis
of influence campaigns.
Xinyi Liu’s CV Page 2 of 3NYC Employment Data Analysis |R, D3.js, Bookdown Nov 2020 – Jan 2021
•Created interactive visualizations (R, D3.js) analyzing employment counts and salary trends across
demographic groups.
•Published a project report using R Bookdown: NYC Employment Analysis Book.
•Finalist, Columbia DSI Best Student Project Competition; presented findings at: Project
Presentation.
Work Experience
Amazon – Applied Science Intern |Causal Inference, Persona Modeling Alexa AI, Summer 2025
•Developed a behavior-conditioned LLM framework to simulate realistic user-AI conversations
grounded in population-level persona groups.
•Leveraged causal inference to refine behavioral segmentation and control dialogue synthesis.
•Demonstrated strong gains in structural realism and behavioral fidelity over eight baseline models.
ByteDance – Data Science Intern |Data Mining, User Segmentation, Summer 2022
•Designed and validated user segments using classification metrics (precision, recall, ROC-AUC)
and cross-validation.
•Analyzed large-scale user behavior logs to identify actionable segment-level engagement trends.
•Built interactive BI dashboards to support product decisions through visualized behavioral
insights.
